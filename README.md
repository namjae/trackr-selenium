This project contains Selenium tests written with [spock](https://code.google.com/p/spock/) to test the
[trackr-frontend](https://github.com/techdev-solutions/trackr-frontend).

How to run the tests
====================
The tests currently assume trackr is running with the http-basic profile on localhost, port 80. Just run `gradle test`
to start the tests!
